# Celebrate LeetCode

When your submission is accepted on LeetCode, this Extension helps to celebrate!
And you can also search friend's result for any LeetCode contest!!

As a fun project, I created this Extension based on a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ria-monga_sidhu-moose-wala-would-do-too-https-activity-7005049528282165248-fsBn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by Ria Monga on Sunday. It took me four hours to create the project, and I had to submit it several times to get it to work!
