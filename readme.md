# Celebrate LeetCode

When your submission is accepted on LeetCode, this Extension helps to celebrate!

As a fun project, I created this Extension based on a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ria-monga_sidhu-moose-wala-would-do-too-https-activity-7005049528282165248-fsBn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by Ria Monga on Sunday. It took me four hours to create the project, and I had to submit it several times to get it to work!

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project

## Important to Note

- Only works on new LeetCode UI: One can update it to work with old version
- Only one song is played: Need to add support for custom song

You can contribute to this project by making a PR
I will update this extension on weekends!!, so stay tuned!!
